<p>Copying movies from your friends?</p>
<p>Have habit of checking imdb results before copying ?</p>
<p>This for you!</p>
<p>Just download from below url. just run <strong>ruby imdb.rb [Movies Folder] .</strong>It will try to collect imdb results of folder name ( not for all ) from google ( sidebar ) Eg: https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Underworld+2003</p>

<p>ruby <strong>imdb.rb /media/Pendrive</strong></p>
<p>Is it Interesting ? We can add more stuff into that.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the rating is more than 7. You can copy to your system folder.</li>
<li>Need to beautify code.</li>
<li>Make it as Gem.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S It works for me. I will work until google changes some css updates in that.</p>
